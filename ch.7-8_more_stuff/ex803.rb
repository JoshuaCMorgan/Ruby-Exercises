# What is exception handling and what problem does it solve?

# Exception handling gives us a process for handling errors in an
# easier and more manageable way.
# It's something we can inject in code to help manage our code more
# easily when an error arises.
# When an error arises, rather than stop execution, the program will continue
# to run as it normally would.
